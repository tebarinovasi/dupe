    Functionality: Item/Fish Duplication Exploit (Duping)
--]]

-- // Services
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

-- // Local Player
local LocalPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer

-- // ==========================================================================================
-- // EXPLOIT LOGIC
-- // The goal is to call the "Sell" event multiple times very quickly,
-- // before a slow or insecure server has time to remove the item from the player's inventory.
-- // ==========================================================================================

-- Assume the game has a remote event for selling fish.
-- Cheaters find this by exploring the ReplicatedStorage.
local SellAllFishEvent = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("SellEvents"):WaitForChild("SellAll")

-- The player would typically execute this function via a GUI button or a keybind.
local function executeDupe()
    print("[Exploit] Attempting to duplicate fish...")

    -- The core of the exploit: spam the sell event.
    -- On a vulnerable server that doesn't use unique item IDs or transactional logic,
    -- the server might process each of these calls before it can confirm the fish
    -- have actually been removed from the inventory from the *first* call.
    for i = 1, 10 do
        -- The cheater tells the server "I want to sell my fish!" ten times in a fraction of a second.
        SellAllFishEvent:FireServer()
        wait() -- A small delay might be added or removed to find the server's sweet spot for the exploit.
    end

    print("[Exploit] Fired sell event multiple times. Check your money balance.")
end

-- // Another common technique is to disconnect at a precise moment.
local function executeLagDupe()
    print("[Exploit] Attempting lag/disconnect duplication...")
    
    -- 1. The cheater fires the sell event once.
    SellAllFishEvent:FireServer()
    
    -- 2. They immediately disconnect their client from the server (using third-party tools).
    -- RATIONALE: They hope the server processes the "give money" part of the transaction
    -- but fails to save the "remove items from inventory" part because the player has disconnected.
    -- When they rejoin, they have both the money AND the original items.
    
    print("[Exploit] Fired sell event and would now disconnect to attempt duping.")
end


-- To run this, a cheater would call executeDupe() or have a tool to perform the lag dupe.
